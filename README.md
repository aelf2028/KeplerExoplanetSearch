# Kepler Exoplanet Search
UTSA CS 3753 / CS 5163 Data Science by Dr. Al Nasr.

##Introduction
The Kepler Space Observatory is a NASA-build satellite that was launched in 2009, which purpose was to find habitable exoplanets outside our star system. The original mission ended in 2013 due to mechanical issues,  but the satellite kept working on a “K2” extended vision.
The dataset created by the Kepler’s explorations contains data on the exoplanets that have been discovered by it since it was launched. The purpose of this analysis is to discover how many planets are outside our solar system that have conditions suitable to support life, and how likely are we to find an exoplanet out there in the known universe.
